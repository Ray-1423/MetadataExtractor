My first actual python project - extracts metadata from pdfs and jpg/jpeg based on the filepath specified by the user
PS - if ur actually using this for some reason instead of a website just run via the GUI python file
PSS - itll try to format the gps coordinates in latitude longitude but if it doesnt work for some reason u might have to look through the raw exif data
